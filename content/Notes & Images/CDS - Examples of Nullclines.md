- The nullclines are in this case: 
	- $y = -4x$ 
	- $y = 2x$
	- And are represented in the **phase space** as the black lines.
- The blue arrows are found via a simulation.
- This should be an **attractive ss** #not-sure-about-this

- The $(0,\ 0)$ point this time is an **unstable ss**.

- **asymptotically stable ss**
- Negative eigenvalues, we will see more in detail later


![[Pasted image 20240623105749.png]]
- **Lyapunov stable ss**
- Immaginary eigenvalues, we will see more in detail later

- **marginally stable ss**
