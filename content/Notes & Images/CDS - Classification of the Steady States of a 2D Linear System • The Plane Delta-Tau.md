###### *Remember*:

> If we have **complex conjugate** [[CDS - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvalues]], meaning: $\lambda_{1,2} = a \pm ib$, then we will obtain form the [[CDS - Theory Behind Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|general solution in 2D]] $\left(x(t) = \alpha \vec v_1 e^{\lambda_1 t} +  \beta \vec v_2 e^{\lambda_2 t}\right)$ can be rewritten in a sinusolidal form, using the **Euler formula**:$$e^{a \pm ib} = e^{at}\left( \cos(bt) + i \sin(bt) \right)$$Such terms represent **growing oscillations** for $a = \operatorname{Re}(\lambda) \gt 0$ and **decaying oscillations** for for $a = \operatorname{Re}(\lambda) \lt 0$, while if the real part is equal to $0$ we will have **non-changing oscillation**.

> We can classify the **steady states** of a **2D** linear systems, using the following notation
> After calculating the [[CDS - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, we define $\tau$ (the ***trace matrix of $A$***) as:$$\tau = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$$And $\Delta$ (the ***determinant of $A$***) as:$$\Delta = \lambda_1 \lambda_2 $$Then we can define the type of steady state and its stability using this graph:<br>![[Pasted image 20240623111011 - Copia.png|333]]

- In case we deal with complex eigenvalues.
- However, again, we will not use this. #not-sure-about-this 
- ==It is important  to understand the difference between positive/negative and real/complex eigenvalues==. #IMPORTANT
