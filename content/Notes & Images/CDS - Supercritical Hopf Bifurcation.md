![[CDS - Hopf Bifurcation General Formula]]

> ***Supercritical Hopf Bifurcation*** $(\sigma = -1)$:
> For the [[CDS - Linearization|linear approximation]], the **steady state** $(0,\ 0)$ is:
> - **stable** if $\beta \lt 0$.
> - **unstable** if $\beta \gt 0$.
> - **marginally stable** if $\beta = 0$.

> For the [[CDS - Hyperbolic Steady States • Hartman-Grobman Theorem|Hartman-Grobman Theorem]] we know that when the system is **NOT** marginally stable, so for $\beta \neq 0$ (in this case) the behaviour of the **non-linear system** is qualitatevly similar to the [[CDS - Linearization|linearized]] one.
> While for $\beta = 0$, since the system is **marginally stable**, meaning at least one of the [[CDS - Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors|eigenvalues]] is null or has real part $0$, then the **steady state** is not [[CDS - Hyperbolic Steady States • Hartman-Grobman Theorem|hyperbolic]], so we are not ablo to reconstruct correctly the [[CDS - Definition of ODE • Definition of a Solution • Definition of Flow • Dynamics • Definition of Phase Plane or Phase Space|phase space]] near the **steady state**.

- For a negative value of $\beta$: $\beta < 0$

![[Pasted image 20240625173025.png]]
- For a positive value of $\beta$: $\beta > 0$
- This is a "real" example of a **limit cycle**.

![[Pasted image 20240625173233.png]]
- For a positive value of $\beta$: $\beta > 0$, like before, but this time the initial conditions this time are inside the **limit cycle**.
- ***NOTE***: the size and shape of the limit cycle is the same (even if it does not look like it), look at the scale of the graphs.

![[Pasted image 20240625173446.png]]
- The amplitude/size of the **limit cycle** depends on $\beta$.

![[Pasted image 20240625173706.png]]
- The **limit cycle** is part/called an **attracting set**.
