Example of a "3D saddle", however this is not the "official name", in 3D we don't distinguish between "*nodes*", "*spirals*", "*saddles*", ...:<br>In general this is referenced as: "2 stable, 1 unstable eigenvectors/eigenvalues"<br>![[Pasted image 20240624114832.png|444]]<br>![[Pasted image 20240624114849.png|444]]<br>![[Pasted image 20240624114918.png|444]]

Example of 2 stable imaginary conjugate, 1 stable eigenvectors:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624115155.png|444]]<br>![[Pasted image 20240624115224.png|444]]
If instead we have 2 stable imaginary conjugate, 1 unstable eigenvectors:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624115407.png|444]]
- Notice how in the **phase plane** the two conjugate eigenvalues converge to $0$, but the third one diverges.

2 marginally-stable imaginary conjugate, 1 unstable eigenvectors:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624115627.png|444]]<br>![[Pasted image 20240624115750.png|444]]
- In the **phase plane** we have 2 sinusodial "constant" function (their amplitdue reamains constant) and 1 exponentially decreasing function.

If instead we have 2 marginally-stable imaginary conjugate, 1 marginally-stable eigenvectors:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624115953.png|444]]
- ==This is an infinite series of separated circles==.

- In 3D we don't distinguish between "*stars*", "*nodes*", ...
