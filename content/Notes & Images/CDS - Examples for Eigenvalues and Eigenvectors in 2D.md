This is the space generated by eigenvector with both positive eigevalues:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624113451.png|333]]
And the flow associated is:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624113514.png|333]]

Example of a saddle (linear):<br>![[Pasted image 20240624113722.png|333]]
- $v_1$ spans the unstable subspace $(E^U)$ 
- $v_2$ spans the stable subspace $(E^S)$ 

Example of a non-linear saddle:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624113853.png|333]]
- near to the ss, the linar approximation is tangent to the manyfold
- As you can see the stable manyfold $(W_{\tiny{\text{LOC}}}^{S})$ has the flow that points toward the **ss**, while for the unstable manyfold $(W_{\tiny{\text{LOC}}}^{U})$ the flow points to infinty.
- The linar approximation is valid only near the **ss**.

If we draw the flow of the non-linar system:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624114503.png|333]]
- Notice the similiraties with the linear system.
- In this case is like the linear system, but it is distorted.
