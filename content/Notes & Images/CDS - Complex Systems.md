- ***[[CDS - Definition of 'Complex Dynamic System'|Definiton of 'Complex Dynamic Systems']]***
	- ***Complex***: Composed of many non-linear elements
	- ***Dynamic***: The patterns forming in the system behave according to the **dynamics**
	- ***Systems***: We need to think of the system as a whole, not as singular elements
- ***Examples of a Complex System***:
	- The human body.
	- Financial markets.
	- Social organizations.
	- Climate.
