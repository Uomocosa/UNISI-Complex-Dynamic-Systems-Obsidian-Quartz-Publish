- $\lambda^2 -\tau \lambda + \Delta$ is called the "charateristic polyomial"

- This is the plot, and with this we can define all the "types of nodes" or flow, for a 2 dimensional system.
- Remember that:
	- $\tau = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$
	- $\Delta = \lambda_1 \cdot \lambda_2$
Example of **nodes** (stable - black flow, and unstable - red flow):<br>![[Pasted image 20240623164011.png|444]]

Example of a **saddle**:<br>![[Pasted image 20240623164131.png|333]]

Analizing the initial conditions on the $x$ and the initial conditions on the $y$ axis, we have made example also in the **phase plane**, and said that:
*The eigenvectors are invariant for the motion*.

- However this is not very clear/useful i think (Lecture 6 27:00) #not-sure-about-this 

Stable (in red) and unstable (in black) spiral:<br>![[Pasted image 20240623164725.png|444]]
- In the **phase plane**, **stable spiral**:<br>![[Pasted image 20240623164803.png|222]]
- **unstable spiral**:<br>![[Pasted image 20240623164825.png|222]]
