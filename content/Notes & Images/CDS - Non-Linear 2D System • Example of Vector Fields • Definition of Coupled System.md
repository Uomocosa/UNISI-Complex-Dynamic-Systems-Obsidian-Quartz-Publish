- This function is periodic over $x$, however monodimensional system cannot present periodicity over $t$, nor oscillations.
- As a sneak-peak: we'll need **imaginary eigenvalues** in a multidimensional system to have oscillations.

- Mass-spring system (no damper).
- Since $\dot x \propto v$ (or because $\dot v \propto x$) we can call this system "***coupled***".
