###### *Remember*:

> Take for example this sytem:$$\left\{\begin{array}{l} \dot x_1 = 10x + y -5 \\ \dot x_2 =  5y  \end{array}\right.$$To find the nullclines we solve the following eqations:$$\dot x = 0$$Since we have only 2 components:$$\left\{\begin{array}{l} \dot x_1 = 0 \\ \dot x_2 =  0  \end{array}\right.$$Meaning:$$\left\{\begin{array}{l} 10x_1 + x_2 -5 = 0 \\ 5x_2 = 0\end{array}\right.$$From this equation we find the two **nullclines**:
> 	1. $x_2 = -x_1 + 5$
> 	2. $x_2 = 0$

> We have also seen [[CDS - Examples of Nullclines|some other examples in 2D]], can be useful to understand and visualize the nullclines.

- #IMPORTANT
- In case of linear system we need the **nullclines**, and **eigenvectors**, to define the phase space.
