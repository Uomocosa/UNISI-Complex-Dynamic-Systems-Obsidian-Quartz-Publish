- This is considered the "simplest case of bifurcation".
- This system has 2 steady states $x_1^* = 0$ and $x_2^* = r$.
- Red parabola: $r < 0$.
- Green parabola: $r > 0$.
- Blue parabola: $r = 0$.
- Changin $r$ this time changes the stability of one of the steady states, and differently from before no steady states disappears.

- Analysis of the stability of the steady states.
- Again when the two steady stated conicide for $r = 0$ the steady state is stable from on part, and unstable from the other part, like for the **saddle-node bifurcation**.

- This is called the "***Transcritical Bifurcation***"
