- eigenvectors ??? and eigenvalues ??? #TODO

- This is an example of how we can study the geometry of the steady state.
- The black point is a **STABLE steady state**, also called "***attractor***".
- The white point is a **UNSTABLE steady state***.
- The arrows define how ??? #TODO the system evolves / the initial condition evolves
- $\dot x$ can also be seen as representig the velocity, as you can see the velocity decreases as you approach the stady state.
