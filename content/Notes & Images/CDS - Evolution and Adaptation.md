Natural systems behave under the genetic drift of evolution and natural selection, which induce changes of some characteristics, which become more common or more rare in the population. 

Evolution gave rise to biodiversity at all scales, from species to microorganisms and molecules. 

**Adaptation results from the dynamic evolution and makes systems able to reach states resilient to external potentially damaging factors**.
