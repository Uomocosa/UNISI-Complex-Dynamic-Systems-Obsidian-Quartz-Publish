Now let's try to visualize better the meaning behind the **bifurcation diagram**:<br>![[Pasted image 20240625175618.png|444]]
![[Pasted image 20240625175636.png|444]]
Each point of the **bifurcation diagram** represents a **phase plane**/**phase space** (with infinite inital conditions), and the lines (dotted and continue) represents the stabilities/**attracting set** of the phase plane:<br>![[Pasted image 20240625175838.png|444]]<br>![[Pasted image 20240625175905.png|444]]

For the subcritical case:<br>![[Pasted image 20240625175945.png|444]]

Let's see also the two hopf biffurcation side by side:<br>![[Pasted image 20240625180040.png|444]]
- ***NOTE***: since the eigenvalues were the same also the "x-axis" is the same both for the "SUPercritcal" and "SUBcritical", what chages is the **limit cycle**.
- ***NOTE***: this graphs is 2D, it should be 3D!

We may find different cases, for different values, here's another example:<br>![[Pasted image 20240625180332.png|333]]
- However if the limit cycles is stable when the ss is unstable, it is still considered a supercritical hopf bifurcation.
- And if the limit cycles is unstable when the ss is stable, it is still considered a subcritical hopf bifurcation.
