Systems theory is the interdisciplinary **study of systems**. 

**System are composed by interacting interdependent parts, exchange energy with the environment, have a given structure, objective, and functioning**. 

They are usually more than the sum of their parts if they show synergistic relationships or emergent behavior.

 ### CT (Continuous Time) vs DT (Discrete Time)
 When talking about a Continuos-Time (**CT**), it means that the time $t$ belongs to a continous set, usally to $\mathbb{R}^{\geq{}0} = \{t\in{}\mathbb{R}: t\geq{}0\}$
 
  Instead if we are talking about a Discrete-Time (**DT**) System, than the the time $t$ belongs to a discrete set, usally the set of natural numbers $\mathbb{N} = \{0, 1, 2, ...\}$
