![[CDS - Hopf Bifurcation General Formula]]

> To understand better this bifurcation also refer to its counterpart, the [[CDS - Supercritical Hopf Bifurcation|supercritical hopf bifurcation]].

> ***Subcritical Hopf Bifurcation*** $(\sigma = +1)$:
> For the [[CDS - Linearization|linear approximation]], the **steady state** $(0,\ 0)$ is:
> - **stable** if $\beta \lt 0$.
> - **unstable** if $\beta \gt 0$.
> - **marginally stable** if $\beta = 0$.
> 
> **NOTE**: this is exactlty like in the [[CDS - Supercritical Hopf Bifurcation|supercritical case]], however the [[CDS - Examples for a Bifurcation Diagram|bifurcation diagram]] will be very different.

- The same eigenvalues as for $\sigma = -1$

- In this case we have a divergence.

- If you choose inital condition outside of the **unstable limit cycle** (or better a "***repuslive limit cycle***"), then you have a divergence.
- We say that for positive value we have "***full instability***", and for negative value we have "***local stability***" (inside the limit cycle).
