In nonlinear systems the change of the output is **not** proportional to the change of the input. 

Most systems are inherently nonlinear in nature. Nonlinear dynamical systems, described by variables changing over time, may appear **chaotic**, **unpredictable**, or **counterintuitive**, contrasting with much simpler linear systems.
