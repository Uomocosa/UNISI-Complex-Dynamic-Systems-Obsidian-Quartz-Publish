### Definition
A complex system consist of a large number of components that interact with each other to produce nontrivial phenomena that cannot be explained by analyzing the individual constituent elements.

---

#### Complex:
- Composed of many non-linear elements
#### Dynamic:
- The patterns forming in the system behave according to the **dynamics**
#### Systems:
- We need to think of the system as a whole, not as singular elements

---

- A small change in the input can be amplified many times (due to the complexity of the system)
- The system are too complex for an human mind, we need to **simulate** them
