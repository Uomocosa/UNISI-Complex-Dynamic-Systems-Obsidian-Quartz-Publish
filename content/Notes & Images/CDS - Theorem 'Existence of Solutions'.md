###### *Remember*:

> ***Theorem 'Existence of Solutions'***: Given an initial condition $x(t_0) = x_0$, and under the hypotesis that $f(x)$ is differentiable, a solution of equation $\dot x = f(x)$ exists and this solution is unique.
> - This theorem implied that a solution in the [[CDS - Definition of ODE • Definition of a Solution • Definition of Flow • Dynamics • Definition of Phase Plane or Phase Space|phase space]] can't intersect itself. It it intersect itself once it will intersect itself infinite times.
> - Solutions are continuos on $x$ in the [[CDS - Definition of ODE • Definition of a Solution • Definition of Flow • Dynamics • Definition of Phase Plane or Phase Space|phase space]].
> - [[CDS - Steady States • Classification of Steady States • Stable • Unstable • Marginally Stable • Attracting • Lyapunov Stable • Asympotically Stable|Steady states]] are constant solutions: fixed points of the [[CDS - Definition of ODE • Definition of a Solution • Definition of Flow • Dynamics • Definition of Phase Plane or Phase Space|phase space]].

> Unique solution in the [[CDS - Definition of ODE • Definition of a Solution • Definition of Flow • Dynamics • Definition of Phase Plane or Phase Space|phase space]] means that given a certain $x_0, \ \bar t$ we obtain a **single point**, as we will see that is always the case.

- So when desining the geometry of the **phase space**, we will have that ==a solution in the phase space intersect itself **infinite times** or **not even once**.==, still under the hypotesis that $f$ is a differentiable function. #not-sure-about-this
