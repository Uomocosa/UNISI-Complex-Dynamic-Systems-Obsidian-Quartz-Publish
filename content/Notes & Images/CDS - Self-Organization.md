In complex systems the organization emerges spontaneously from local interactions between parts of the system that initially is disordered. 

Local interactions determine the formation of behavior at the global level. 

The organization is decentralized, distributed over all the components of the system. 

It is typically robust, **making the system able to survive or self-repair negative disturbations**.

The behavior of self-organized systems is often **unpredictable**.
