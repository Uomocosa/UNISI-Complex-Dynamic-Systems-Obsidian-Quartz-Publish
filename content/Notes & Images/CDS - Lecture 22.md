- If we continue to scale as you can see we find the "original" form at all scales.
- A fractal has this characteristic: "*It repeats itself at all scales*"

- The bifurcatin diagram of the logistic map we have seen before.
- This diagram is a fractal.
- We we enter the chaotic regime, we actually have passed an infinite number of flip bifurcation (doubling the period each time).

- The first inspiration that Mandelbrot had for fractals.

- See the examples below.

- You can take the circles such that there are $0$ intersections.

![[Pasted image 20240703120051.png]]
- The intersection you find (open or closed curve) are at leased 1 or 2:
	-  The least amount of point you can intersect is $1$.
	- For a closed line the minimum amount of intersection will be $2$ ⇒ topological dimension $2$.
- So as we have seen previously a set of point has topologial dimension $0$ ⇒ An open/closed curve has topologial dimension $1$

- We are in **3D** so now the circle becomes a sphere.
- The intersection between the sphere and the plane is a closed curve.
- So as we have seen previously an open/closed curve has topologial dimension $1$ ⇒ a plane has topological dimension $2$

![[Pasted image 20240703120852.png]]
- We cannot use topological dimension for these sets.

- See the examples below.

- $r$ : scale.
- $N$ : copies of the first image.
- *similarity dimension*: $d$.
- **If the self-similarity/similarity dimension is equal to the topological dimension** ⇒ ==Then the object is not a fractal==, and this is the case.
- This object has also topological dimension $= 2$.

- The topological dimension of both should be $1$. #not-sure-about-this 
- For the cantor set we have $d < 1$, while for the Koch curve $d > 1$.
	- Take for example the Koch curve, it is so rough that it is more than a mono-dimensional curve. (a monodimensional curve has less "surface") #not-sure-about-this 
	- While the cantor set is less (a monodimensional curve has more "surface") #not-sure-about-this
