- The blue curve has a $0$-derivative for $x = 0$

Let's analyze the steady steates.
For $r<0$:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624165627.png|444]]
And in case of the blue curve, $r = 0$:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624165659.png|444]]
While for $r > 0$:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624165737.png|444]]
- From the red curve, to the green curve, we have that:
	1. $x_1^*$ looses stability.
	2. $x_2^*, \ x_3^*$ are born, and are stable.
- We say that for $r=0$ is when this change happens.

- This is called the "***Supercritical Pitchfork Bifurcation***"
- We can say that globally this system is stable.
