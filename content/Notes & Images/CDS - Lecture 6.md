- $\lambda^2 -\tau \lambda + \Delta$ is called the "charateristic polyomial"

![[Pasted image 20240623163035.png]]
- This is the plot, and with this we can define all the "types of nodes" or flow, for a 2 dimensional system.
- Remember that:
	- $\tau = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$
	- $\Delta = \lambda_1 \cdot \lambda_2$
Example of **nodes** (stable - black flow, and unstable - red flow):<br>![[Pasted image 20240623164011.png|444]]

Example of a **saddle**:<br>![[Pasted image 20240623164131.png|333]]

Analizing the initial conditions on the $x$ and the initial conditions on the $y$ axis, we have made example also in the **dynamics graph**, and said that:
*The eigenvectors are invariant for the motion*.

#TODO Repeat the missing part on the lecture
- The "***limit cycle***" is a robust oscillation, meaning that they are attracting

- In non-linear system we will observe that non only points can act as attractors (in linear case the **stbale ss** act as actractors).<br>*In non-linear systems there can be closed curves in the **phase space** that can act as actrators*. #IMPORTANT <br>And there can also be closed curves that do the opposite (like for **unstable ss** in linear systems)
- You can imagine that in non-linear sytems the steady state can also be closed curves.

This is a possible **phase space** of a non-linear system:<br>![[Pasted image 20240623171721.png|333]]
- The red circle acts as an actractor.
- This **phase space** is impossible to be obtained in a linear system.

And its **dynamics**:<br>![[Pasted image 20240623172059.png|333]]
- Actracting curve, **robust oscillation**.

If we focus on the actractive circle, from an initial condition inside this curve:<br>![[Pasted image 20240623172359.png|333]]
- In red the actractive circle.
- This means that at the center of the circle we need to have a **repulsive ss**.
- This actractive curve/circle is called "***limit cycle***":<br>![[Pasted image 20240623172632.png|333]]

- If the eigenvalues are hyperbolic, then the linearization is "succeful", mening that both stability and flow are qualitativly the same.
- *Non-hyperbolic ss may produce dynamics that are not predicted by the linearized system*, so we cannot analyze them via linearization.
- If all eigenvalues are different from $0$, just looking at the eigenvalues is sufficient to conclude about the stability of the steady states, and also about the geometry of the phase space near the ss<br>But if there is at least one $0$-eigenvale, then we cannot predict the geometry of the phase space, near the ss by analyzing the linearized system, we need to use other tools.
- The presence of $0$-eigenvalues may produce a very complicated dynamic, including **limit cycles**, and also the **strange actractors**, so we need to study really well the system if this is the case.

![[Pasted image 20240623174053.png]]
- In case of hyperbolic steady states, not only the property of stability of the ss are similar in the non-linear and linearized system, but also the geometry nearby.
- Also in the non-linear case we can distinguish between stable and unstable **manyfolds** (or subspaces).

![[Pasted image 20240623174922.png]]
- **stable/unstable nodes**, **saddles**, and **stable/unstable spirals** can be succefully analyzed via linearization.
- **limit cycles** and **strange actractors** cannot.
