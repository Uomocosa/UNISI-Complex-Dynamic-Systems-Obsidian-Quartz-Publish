> If we analyze the [[CDS - Supercritical Pitchfork Bifurcation|supercritical pitchfork bifurcation]], with respect to the [[CDS - Subcritical Pitchfork Bifurcation|subcritical pitchfork bifurcation]], we can see that, for the **SUPERcritical** case, the system is a lot more unstable, since for the supercrictical case, the system will never diverge:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624170728 - Copia.png|333]]<br>![[Pasted image 20240624170942 - Copia.png|333]]

If we analyze the **supercritical pithfork bifurcation**, we can see that:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624170728.png|444]]
- For whichever value $r$ assumes, the system will converge, except for $x^*=0,\ r=0$ for which the system will remain at $0$ (unstable steady state)

While for the ***subcritical*** case:<br>![[Pasted image 20240624170942.png|444]]
- The system is a lot more unstable.

> ***NOTE***: 
> A bifurcation only appers when there is a non-hyperbolic steady state, this is true also for higher dimensions systems.
